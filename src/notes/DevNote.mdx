TODO:
 -  Add Dynamic Loading / Pagination (Mansory-like) with dev node script or vite plugin
    
    Won't it be easy? I think I even shouldn't have menu.ts manually configured.

    Just let a script search for every `mdx/md` file under `notes/` and
    split it into multiple `.ts` file describing the title, url, abstract, etc. of articles in this page.
    When display, just use dynamic import of these `.ts` file.

    And Vite plugin might allow you to respond to every file change.
