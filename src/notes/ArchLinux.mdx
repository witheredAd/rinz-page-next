But no use in Arch (Linux 6.10.4, KDE Plasma 6, linuxqq)

## VSCode no fcitx in KDE:

This confirmed work. 我现在可以输入中文。Also: apply the same parameter to linuxqq, then get best experience, and the problem above got fixed too.

## Fix flickering:
seems like a ozone bug. use `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform-hint=auto --enable-wayland-ime`, instead of `--ozone-platform=wayland`

## compiled KDE addons on Arch from the AUR should be rebuilt after Plasma update:
`paru -S --rebuild`

## Wine Mirror's Edge:

This is an old EA game released in 2009. I managed to get it running on Win 10 but not Win 11.

So I tried wine. Luckily I finally pickled all the problems and played happily.

At first it cannot be launched, complaining 'Failed to find default engine .ini ...' or some dlls are missing.
The solution is to launch the Mirror's Edge.exe in Binaries/ folder, not the one in the root.

Then the game launched, but with no sound in game (only startup video has sound). The solution is to install dx9:

You can change game resolution in game settings then.

The game is now playable and is smooth, but to me, I want to use an XBox Controller,
which is not recognized by the game in wine.

So I tried my luck on Proton. I do all the settings above in proton (using protontricks),
and XBox controller is just usable! only the xbox led light is not lighted, but that doesn't matter.
I learned that nowadays linux came with out-of-box support for controllers, so that maybe wouldnt be a problem.

The good thing of proton is that when i tried to alt+tab switch to another window on kde, the game wont stuck.
and obs also works well with it on pipewire (i captured the whole screen if you mind).

I've tried wine many (maybe 7 or 8?) years ago, and never thought it can be as smooth as today!
